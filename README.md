**Air Quality Analysis Using Satellite Data and Web Application**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains an analysis of air quality using satellite data. It includes:

*   A Jupyter Notebook for data processing and analysis.
    
*   A Web Application for interactive visualization of the results.
    

**Repository Contents**

*   app.py - Main script for the web application, providing an interactive interface for exploring air quality data.
    
*   air-quality-using-satellite-data.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for processing and visualizing air quality data using satellite imagery.
    

**Installation and Setup**

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

**1\. Clone the Repository**Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

git clone https://github.com/Krishna17-bit/Air-quality-analysis.git  
cd air-quality-analysis-webapp   `

**2\. Install Required Packages**If a requirements.txt file is provided, you can install all dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt   `

Otherwise, manually install the necessary packages such as Flask, pandas, and others used in the project.

**3\. Run the Data Analysis**Open the air-quality-using-satellite-data.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to analyze and visualize the air quality data.

**4\. Launch the Web Application**To start the web application, run:

 python app.py   `

After starting the application, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the web interface.

**Usage**

*   Data Analysis: Use the Jupyter Notebook for detailed air quality analysis using satellite data.
    
*   Web Application: Visualize the analyzed data interactively through the web app.
